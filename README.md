# Extra info
These are notes on Unreal Engine that I need practice with or are here for future reference.

I am constantly working with Unreal, so I am starting to remove things that are obvious to me by now.
One example are notes to basic classes like AActor, APlayerController and ACharacter. After working with them a lot I don't need notes on them anymore and feel like there are a lot of other resources that cover them.

I am trying to remove stuff that is out-of-date but if you find anything let me know PR, issue, email whatever you prefer.

Thanks for reading and happy learning
