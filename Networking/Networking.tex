    Networking in UE4 is called 'Replication'

    \section{Basics}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item is Actor-centric
            \item how to create 3 instances and connect them to the server (local debugging) :NEXT LINE:
            \item Editor Preferences $\rightarrow$ type 'Multi' $\rightarrow$ tick 'Enable Network Emulation'
            \item 
            \item replication goes only SERVER $\rightarrow$ CLIENT but CLIENT $\nrightarrow$ SERVER
            \item 
            \item set \colorbox{mygray}{\lstinline{NetUpdateFrequency}} to an appropriate value ex.: 10 = $\frac{1}{5}$ $\rightarrow$ update every 5th of a second (0.2s)
            \item \colorbox{mygray}{\lstinline{net.UseAdaptiveNetUpdateFrequency}} combined with \colorbox{mygray}{\lstinline{MinNetUpdateFrequency}}(minimum update attempts) and \colorbox{mygray}{\lstinline{NetUpdateFrequency}}(maximum update attempts) can improve perfermonce
            \item 
            \item clients must reconnect to the server for some actions, this is called Non-seamless-travel and occurs when:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item loading a map for the first time
                \item connecting to a server for the first time as a client
                \item you want to end a multiplayer game and start a new one
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

        \uline{}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Server Only: Exist on the server (ex.: AGameMode)
            \item Server \& Client: Exist on the Server and on all Clients (ex.: AGameState, APlayerState, APawn )
            \item Server \& Owning Client: Exist on the Server and the owning Client (ex.: APlayerController)
            \item Owning Client Only: Exist only on the Client (ex.: AHUD, UMG Widgets)
        \end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \uline{Network Modes:} is a property of the world and can have the following values:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item NM\_Standalone := for singleplayer and local-multiplayer
            \item NM\_Client := runs the game without any server-logic
            \item NM\_ListenServer := runs the game and accepts connections
            \item NM\_DedicatedServer := hosts a network multiplayer session without graphics
        \end{itemize}
        \item \uline{Replication-Features:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Creation \& Destruction := when an authoritative version of a repicated Actor is spawned on a server, it automatically generates remote proxis
            \item Movement-Replication := bReplicateMovement = true and the Actor will replicate \textit{Location,Rotation,Velocity}
            \item Variable-Replication := any variable that is 
            \item Component-Replication := 
            \item Remote-Procedure-Calls := 
        \end{itemize}
        \item \uline{Network Roles:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item None := the actor has no role in a network game and does not replicate
            \item Authority := the actor is authoritativ and replicates its information to remote proxies of it on other machines
            \item Simulated Proxy (this are most actors) := the actor is a remote proxy that is controlled entirely by an authoritative actor on another machine
            \item Autonomous Proxy (ex. player character) := the actor is a remote proxy that is capable of performing some functions locally, but receivs corrections from an authoritative actor
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

        \uline{GameState}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item AGameStateBase \& AGameState
            \item replicated to all Clients
            \item most important class for shared information between Server \& Clients
            \item keeps track of the Game State ex.: GameMode contains total KillCount GameState the Kills for every player
            \item 
        \end{itemize}

        \uline{PlayerState}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item most important class for a specific Player
            \item each Player has a PlayerState
            \item access through PlayerArray inside of GameState
            \item 
            \item good for ex.:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item PlayerName
                \item Score
                \item Ping
                \item GuildID
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

        \uline{Player Controller:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item exists on the Client \& Server
            \item Clients don't know of each other PlayerControllers
            \item GerPlayerController(0):
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Listen-Server: gets the Listen-Servers PlayerController
                \item Client: gets the Clients PlayerController
                \item Dedicated-Server: gets the first Clients \
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

        \uline{Userful Classes:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item AInfo := is an actor used to store information (is an actor in order to use replication)
            \item 
        \end{itemize}
