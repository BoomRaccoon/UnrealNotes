        \begin{itemize}
            \item assets need some data that has to be derived
            \item is not in source control
            \item derived data is need for example for precompiled materials
            \item Boot-DDC: so the load-up is faster
            \item Local-DDC: derived-data needed for the projects
            \item DDC-Pak: ends with ddp and used for the engine and sample projects
            \item Shared-DDC: very usefull for teams \& Studios
        \end{itemize}
